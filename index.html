      No.

      ELI5: The Merge switches off Proof-of-Work in favour of Proof-of-Stake, reducing Ethereum's <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/">energy usage by ~99.95%</a> and <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html">making the system more secure</a>. This is a consensus layer change, not an execution layer change, so there is no difference to you, the user. However, it is already possible to enjoy lower fees by moving to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/">secure layer 2 solutions</a>!

    <p>
      ELI10: <em>Akshually</em>, during the Merge, block times are reduced from appearing on average every 13 seconds to appearing according to a fixed schedule every 12 seconds. This small increase in capacity could lead to a small decrease in fees. In any case, this would not be a significant decrease, and base layer operations will probably remain expensive for the foreseeable future.

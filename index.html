      No.

      ELI5: The Merge switches off Proof-of-Work in favour of Proof-of-Stake. This is a consensus layer change, not an execution layer, so there is no difference to the user. However, it is already possible to enjoy lower fees by moving to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/">secure layer 2 solutions</a>!

      ELI10: <em>Akshually</em>, during the switch, block times are reduced from an average of roughly 13 seconds to an average of 12 seconds. This small increase in capacity could lead to a small decrease in fees. In any case, this would not be a significant decrease, and base layer operations will probably remain expensive for the foreseeable future.
